### Inspiration
- Rhythm tengoku
- Rhythm heaven fever

## Theme
- Two colours
- On edge 

## Ideas
So far we have:
- Rhythm game to do with combining colours (mixing -- colour theory) to deal damage
- If the player is hit, is knocked back so they are always 'on edge'
- Guitar hero with 3 primary colour buttons (or 2 for the theme maybe) and you have to click the right combination when a projectile enters your hitbox
- Theme idea: paint mixing shop - customers with orders - call and response system
